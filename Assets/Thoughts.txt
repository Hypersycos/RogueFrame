John's Thoughts on ROR2

Small trash mobs which are easy then insta-die
Want to be hybrid

Thoughts on Warframe
Lost in the sauce. What do

Game Ideas:
Sort of time pressure, clear stage in certain time?
Competition? PvE race
Team vs Team - invade others?
Hot potato

TODO:
	Stat rewrite?
		StatRegeneration owner and callback?
			Allows progress tracking
			Allows bonuses to trigger off HoT and DoT
		StatRegeneration valid targets
			Allows choosing what health pools HoTs can heal (e.g. no overhealth)
			Allows DoTs which target specific health pools
		
		StatSystem Container?
	
		Custom Editor for StatInstance & co
	


OTHER GAME
Splatoon + Infection?

Voxel MMO:
	Start on barren-ish island (or friends) - will serve as home base
	Create vessel to travel through space (or space analogue) - vehicle fights like p101?
	Floating shards - shared p2p instances?
